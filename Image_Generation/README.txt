After event generation, it is time to plot the data in form of image.

FIRST STEP : Text file generated in event generation should be converted to a tree data format.
    This is done via a root script. The correct root script is generated by the generate_command.py script.

(a) Open generate_command.py and edit the number of tracks that you have.
(b) Then run this file as follows
   python generate_command.py
This creates a new script called makeMyTree.C
(c) Now run makeMyTree.C in root as follows
   [].x makeMyTree.C
This creates a root file called training_testing.root



SECOND STEP : 
       After getting tree from first step, go to the plotmaker script.

If we have 50 tracks, and 16 layers, then N=50*16=800

At the root prompt (replace N with the correct number)
[].x plotmaker.C(N)

This will make the images in a folder called images/
