# CNN-based machine learning on a toy detector model
This repo contains the code that I wrote for a semester project in experimental high-energy physics. 

# Project Description
We wanted to train a convolution neural network to differentiate between low and high pt, smeared or displaced
tracks of leptons generated using a toy detector model, with a focus on trigger application at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
